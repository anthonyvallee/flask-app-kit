# Flask Essentials Kit

This is the application template for [generator-flask-app](https://github.com/anthonyvallee/generator-flask-essentials-kit).
This is a **Yeoman generator** for a basic Flask application.
It is heavily inspired by Nick Janetakis's [build-a-saas-app-with-flask](https://github.com/nickjj/build-a-saas-app-with-flask) project structure.

## Setup
The setup is simple.
```sh
mkvirtualenv YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --editable .
```

To start the server, proceed with : `python manage.py server`.
